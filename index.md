Hello, my name is Iliass Tahiri. I am a research engineer working in the field of material science. My most recent are listed in Blog section. If you are interested in construction of this blog please read [Implementation of the blog]() post.

I hope you enjoy some of the content in this blog!

My research areas are quite broad. My primary research interests are:

Modeling of materials: using mathematical and computational models to simulate the behavior of different materials, such as concrete and asphalt, under various conditions.

Poromechanics: This is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanics and porous media theory to understand the behavior of porous materials, such as concrete, wood, asphalt...

Cement and concrete research: study the properties and behavior of cement and concrete, such as their strength, durability, and resistance to various environmental factors, mainly under at low temperature. Here is link to my [Ph.D.](https://www.theses.fr/2021ENPC0038)

Asphalt and bitumen research: study the properties and behavior of asphalt and bitumen, such as their viscoelastic behavior, rheology, and aging process.

Numerical simulations: conduct computer simulations to analyze the behavior of materials and systems.
