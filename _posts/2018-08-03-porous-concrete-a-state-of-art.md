This article contains a brief introduction about pervious concrete. The main aim of this research project, "Freeze-thaw resistance of porous concrete," is to understand the mechanisms involved in the process of damage that occurs when pervious concrete is subject to freeze-thaw cycles in saturated conditions. The main steps of this work include:

* Undertaking a thorough bibliographic study to assess the state of the art
* Designing experiments that can lead to a significant understanding of the physical phenomena involved in the process
* Understanding how damage occurs
* Building a model that captures the mechanisms of damage in pervious concrete
* Improving the mix design of pervious concrete to resist freeze-thaw cycles.

This research project is initiated by the Laboratory NAVIER and Lafarge-Holcim, I will begin the new challenge of a PhD in November 2018 to investigate this topic.

## A recurrent question : Why porous concrete ?

Pervious concrete, also known as porous concrete or permeable concrete, is a type of concrete that allows water to pass through it, rather than running off of it like traditional concrete. This allows water to infiltrate the soil and recharge groundwater reserves, rather than running off into stormwater systems. The porosity also reduces the runoff volume and decrease the water treatment required, this can help to alleviate flooding and reduce the burden on stormwater systems. Additionally, Pervious concrete can reduce vehicle noise as the porous structure of the concrete can absorb sound. The open pores of the pervious concrete also filter the stormwater and remove pollutants, making it an environmentally friendly option.

## Pervious concrete durability challenges

Freeze-thaw cycles: Pervious concrete is particularly susceptible to damage from freeze-thaw cycles, as the porous structure of the concrete allows water to penetrate and freeze, causing the concrete to expand and crack.

Clogging: Pervious concrete can become clogged with debris, such as leaves and dirt, reducing its ability to drain water and increasing the risk of flooding.

Low resistance: Pervious concrete typically has lower strength and durability compared to traditional concrete, making it more prone to wear and tear over time.

These durability challenges can lead to a reduction in the performance of pervious concrete, and can also make it more difficult to maintain and repair. These durability issues can be addressed by designing mix and improving the construction techniques, which will be a focus of my research.

## Pervious concrete composition

This type of concrete, Pervious Concrete (PC), is similar to normal concrete, with the main difference being that PC contains little or no fine aggregate.

The key to creating a porous concrete is using single-sized aggregate. The composition of pervious concrete includes: single-sized aggregate, cement, binder, water, set retarder, and viscosity modifier.

The porosity of pervious concrete ranges from 5-35%. The higher the porosity, the more water can pass through it. However, this also means that the strength of pervious concrete is reduced. Finding the optimal porosity for the specific application is important for ensuring the concrete will perform well over time.

Through this blog, I will try to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of my work, my ideas, and my findings. The next step in this journey is to define the project. Therefore, the next article related to this topic will be: **Porous concrete, a state of the art**.
**To be continued...**
